# Santa Barbara County Regional Priority Plan for Wildfire Resiliance EEMS Modeling Repository

## About This Repository

This repository is meant to document the various methological approaches and geoprocessing workflows taken in building the complete EEMS model. The best way to view this is to look at each Jupyter Notebook in numerical order.

The final EEMS model is available to view on both EEMS Online and Data Basin. To view data layers used in these models go to the [Data Basin RPP group](https://databasin.org/groups/a7a78b77e731438ab564e033d5d221f4/).

## About The Project

[Cachuma Resource Conservation District (RCD)](https://www.rcdsantabarbara.org/) is working in partnership with Conservation Biology Institute, LegacyWorks, and Sharyn Main Consulting on this Regional Priority Plan (RPP), which is a flagship project of the [Santa Barbara County Conservation Blueprint](https://consbio.org/products/projects/sb-blueprint). Funded by the California Coastal Conservancy, the RPP helps with the planning, mapping, and prioritization of projects that will proactively address wildfire threat in Santa Barbara County, as well as improve forest and habitat health.

The RPP is a multi-prong collaboration, which focuses on public and private land in the wildland/urban interface (WUI). CBI will develop a sophisticated decision-support mapping tool to not only predict areas of high fire-risk on a landscape scale, but also help the community prioritize where fire risk mitigation projects should occur. The tool will serve as a community resource within the Santa Barbara County Conservation Blueprint and should improve communication, network building, and support community priorities through a regional approach to fire resilience and habitat health. The project team is talking with the many agencies and stakeholders involved, and facilitating the collaborative decision-making process.
